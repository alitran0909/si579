        Inspiration:"And then, on the other, other hand, there’s Miyazaki’s pursuit of ma in the film, which he described in a 2002 interview with Roger Ebert as the Japanese term for “emptiness,” and involves characters doing things like sitting in thought, waiting at a bus stop, or letting out a deep sigh—essentially, taking a moment to just exist regardless of whether it advances the plot or not. In fact, Miyazaki proclaimed ma to be in intentional opposition to the clearly defined and decidedly linear cause-and-effect-style of storytelling—the “busyness,” as he called it—that viewers, particularly in the West, had become used to.",

        Inspiration: "Director Hayao Miyazaki is said to have been inspired to create Spririted Away by a friend of his daughter's and a growing dissatisfaction with media aimed at preteen girls: 'I made this film for five young girls who are daughters of friends of mine and who visit me at my cabin in the mountains every summer...I read some of the manga the girls left at my cabin, and it struck me that we have been providing them with nothing but a certain kind of cheap romance, which is not what 10-year-old girls really dream about'",

        imdbID: "tt0347149",
        Type: "movie",
        Inspiration: "Influenced by Miyazaki's opposition to the United States' invasion of Iraq in 2003, Howl's Moving Castle contains strongly anti-war themes. Miyazaki stated that he 'had a great deal of rage about [the Iraq war],' which led him to make a film that he felt would be poorly received in the US. In the movie, Madame Suliman appears to have only sadistic motivations for creating conflict, and despite being omniscient, is unable to recognize the idiocy of the war until the very end of the story. This reflects Miyazaki's desire to show real-world conflicts as also being somewhat arbitrary and fueled by the desires of capricious people.",

        imdbID: "tt0874766",
        Type: "movie",
        Inspiration: "The artwork that stunned and inspired Miyazaki was, of course, John Everett Millais’s Ophelia (1851-52), one of the iconic hallmarks of Pre-Raphaelite painting depicting the drowning of its titular subject in Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Millais interprets the passage in which Queen Gertrude retells how Ophelia, stricken with madness and grief for the death of her father and the strange behaviour of her love Hamlet, fell into a brook while collecting flowers and drowned under the weight of ‘her garments, heavy with their drink, / Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay / To muddy death.’2 The painting is, as Miyazaki observes, incredibly detailed and precise in its brushwork – as well as in its careful attention to symbolism, and floriography in particular.",
